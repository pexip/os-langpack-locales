.TH LOCALE-GEN 8 "March 2005" "Debian GNU/Linux"
.SH "NAME" 
locale-gen \- compile a list of locale definition files

.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.B locale-gen
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIlocale\fR] [\fIlanguage\fR] ...

.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
Compiled locale files take about 50MB of disk space, and most users
only need few locales.  In order to save disk space, compiled locale
files are not distributed in the
.B locales
package, but selected locales are automatically generated when this
package is installed by running the
.B locale-gen
program.

If a list of languages and/or locales is specified as arguments, then
\fBlocale-gen\fR only generates these particular locales and adds the new ones
to /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local.  Otherwise it generates all supported
locales.

.PP
Locale data files can be stored either in a single archive file,
.BR /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive ,
or in a deep tree where individual files are stored under
.BR /usr/lib/locale/<locale_name>/LC_* .
But unlike the
.B locales
package, compiled locale definitions are not removed when running
.BR locale-gen ,
and locales are compiled again only if locale source files have changed.

.SH "OPTIONS" 
These options override settings found in
.BR /etc/belocs/locale-gen.conf .

.IR FILE .

.SH "AUTHOR" 
The
.B locale-gen
program was originally written by Debian GNU libc maintainers,
and has been improved by Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org> for
the
.B belocs-locales-bin
package.  This manual page has been rewritten from scratch to
document the current behavior.
